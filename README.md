Installation
To get started with the Solar Radiation Predictor, follow these steps:

Clone the repository:
git clone https://github.com/heenap04/solar-radiation-predictor-

Navigate to the project directory:
cd solar-radiation-predictor

Install the required dependencies:
pip install -r requirements.txt

Usage
To use the Solar Radiation Predictor, follow these steps:
Prepare your dataset with the required meteorological parameters.

Train the model using the provided training script:
python train_model.py --data_path path_to_your_dataset

Use the trained model to make predictions:
python predict.py --model_path path_to_trained_model --input_data path_to_input_data
The predictions will be saved or displayed as specified in the predict.py script.


Data
The project uses historical weather data to train the machine learning models. The required parameters include:
Temperature
